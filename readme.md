Inhalation health benchmarks and references.


## Change Log :notebook:
Notable changes to this project.


### 2018-02-01

#### Changes
- Arsine(7784-42-1) cancer IHB removed. Was previously assumed equivalent to Arsenic.


### 2017-04-01

#### Changes
- MPSFs for Lead and Lead compounds updated to align with IRAP modeling results. This corrects for the previous modeling using the default _Henry's Law constant_ assigned to inorganic metals.
- All inhalation health benchmarks rounded to 2 significant digits
- All of MDH's HRV and HBV chronic inhalation health benchmarks rounded to 1 significant digit, except for benzene
- Tetrachloroethylene (Perchloroethylene) non-cancer IHB updated from 100 to 15 ug/m3 per MDH guidance dated July 2014
- Napthalene cancer IHB set to 9 ug/m3 per MDH guidance dated Feb. 2017
- Ethylene Oxide cancer IHB set to EPA's IRIS value updated Feb. 2017
- Trimethylbenzenes non-cancer IHB set to EPA's IRIS value updated Sept. 2016
- Ethanol specific risk values identified in references, rather than on separate rows
- Chromic acid mists and dissolved Cr(VI) aerosols CAS# changed to _18540-29-9-aer_

#### Bug fixes
- Benzo(k)fluoranthene CAS# changed to _207-08-9_  
- Furfural CAS# changed to _98-01-1_  
- Formic Acid (ethanol facility) CAS# changed to _64-18-6_
- Ethylene dibromide (Dibromoethane) changed to _Ethylene dibromide (1,2-Dibromoethane)_
- Methylene Bromide CAS# 74-95-3 changed to _Dibromomethane (Methylene Bromide) CAS# 74-95-3_
